- Fixed capitalization of idenntifiers.
- Prefixed public definitions with "wb_" since there are no namespaces in C
- Tried make namming consistent; use line everywhere instead of entry in some places
- Fixed a memory corruption bug in c_wb_read: definition_table pointed to a local automatic variable
- Replaced idenntifiers that were less than 3 characters
- Deleted unused variables
- Fixed a memory leak in c_wb_new that happened if new_page failed
