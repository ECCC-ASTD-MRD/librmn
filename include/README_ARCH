The file [ARCH-COMPILER]/rpn_macros_arch.h, arch_specific.hf
goes with the type of ARCH and type of compiler 
(unrelated to version of compiler version)
ie: AIX,Linux,xlf (ARCH)
ie: Intel, pgi, gfortran (compiler)
So in the GoaS design for CMAKE, I kept a copy for each different type:
include/AIX-powerpc/arch_specific.hf
include/AIX-powerpc/llapi.h
include/AIX-powerpc/rpn_macros_arch.h
include/Linux-ppc64/arch_specific.hf
include/Linux-ppc64/rpn_macros_arch.h
include/Linux-ppc64le/arch_specific.hf
include/Linux-ppc64le/rpn_macros_arch.h
include/Linux-x86_64-gfortran/arch_specific.hf
include/Linux-x86_64-gfortran/rpn_macros_arch.h
include/Linux-x86_64-intel/arch_specific.hf
include/Linux-x86_64-intel/rpn_macros_arch.h
include/Linux-x86_64-pgi/arch_specific.hf
include/Linux-x86_64-pgi/rpn_macros_arch.h

unlike in our current system which goes with each version of librmn:

The file in include/Linux-x86_64-intel/rpn_macros_arch.h is found in:
/ssm/net/rpn/libs/19.6-beta/compiler-includes_4.14_all/include/Linux_x86-64_intel-19.0.3.199/rpn_macros_arch.h (EC)
/fs/ssm/eccc/mrd/rpn/libs/19.6-beta/compiler-includes_4.14_all/include/Linux_x86-64_intel-19.0.3.199 (Science)
or
/ssm/net/rpn/libs/19.2/compiler-includes_4.14_all/include/sles-11-broadwell-64-xc40/PrgEnv-intel-5.2.82/rpn_macros_arch.h Linux_x86-64_intel-19.0.3.199/rpn_macros_arch.h (EC)
or
/ssm/net/rpn/libs/19.2/compiler-includes_4.14_all/include/ubuntu-18.04-skylake-64/intel-19.0.3.199/rpn_macros_arch.h (EC)

ALL these files are IDENTICAL for intel, Linux based architecture.

The file rpn_macros_arch.h
for AIX is at:
/ssm/net/rpn/libs/19.2/compiler-includes_4.14_all/include/AIX/rpn_macros.h
which is different because it is for AIX.
