These routines: 
compiler_includes/arc4.h
compiler_includes/cgossip.h
compiler_includes/ftn2c_helper.h
compiler_includes/ftnmacros.hf
compiler_includes/gossip.h
compiler_includes/md5.h
compiler_includes/rmnlib.h
compiler_includes/rpnmacros.h
compiler_includes/rpnmacros_global.h

are a subset copied from:

/ssm/net/rpn/libs/19.6-beta/compiler-includes_4.14_all/include (EC)
or
/fs/ssm/eccc/mrd/rpn/libs/19.6-beta/compiler-includes_4.14_all/include (Science)
(Necessary for GoaS) but if linking to libraries, there are the ones in
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES that must exist:
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/DlInterface.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/Interp1D_Arguments.inc
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/Interp1D_Arguments_X.inc
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/WhiteBoard.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/WhiteBoard.hf
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/clib_interface.cdk
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/codes.cdk
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/convert_ip.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/convert_ip123.inc
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/convip_plus.inc
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/cpu_type.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/dlfcn.inc
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/excdes.inc
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/fnom.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/gmm.hf
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/gmm_constants.hf
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/gmm_definitions.inc
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/gmm_internal_constants.inc
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/gmm_nulls.inc
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/ip_kind.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/mgi.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/msg.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/plugins.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/proto.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/slab.h
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/whiteboard_interface_omp.cdk
rmn/PUBLIC_INCLUDES/whiteboard_interface_st.cdk

But there are many more routines (*.h,*.hf, *.cdk) - 
Are they still used?

For rpncomm, Yes, they are essential and one big issue with GoaS is that
the routines from RPNCOMM must be pre-generated as they are not 
available in rpncomm in the GIT. rpncomm should have a directory called
'PUBLIC_INCLUDES' as well - would be so helpful for GoaS.

The routines/links were just copied from one version of librmn to another
Every librmn version has this:
/ssm/net/rpn/libs/[ver]/compiler-includes_4.14_all/include (EC)
or
/fs/ssm/eccc/mrd/rpn/libs/[ver]/compiler-includes_4.14_all/include (Science)
